# Heart Disease Prediction using KNN

## Overview
A machine learning classification project that uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict the presence of heart disease based on medical attributes.

## Workflow
- Dataset loading and inspection
- Basic EDA and data understanding
- Checking and handling missing values
- Feature-target separation
- Train-test split
- Model training using KNN
- Model evaluation

## Tools
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
